### Blog Settings and options

First setting is blog page, You need to create a page and set it as the blog index page. Let's create a page and name it "Latest news". Go to _admin panel->Pages->add new_ and create the page.

> **Notice:** If you want the page title in two line as it is in our demo you must enter a "|" between words. So our blog page title will be "Latest | News"

After adding the page we must set it as blog index. Go to _admin panel ->settings->reading_ and set the "Front page displays" to "Static page" and select "Latest news" in "Post page" field. Now you are good to go, just add a link to that "Latest news" page in menu and enjoy your blog.
